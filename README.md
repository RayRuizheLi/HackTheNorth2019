# AR Voice ML Ninjutsu Battle Simulator
An anime figure battle station that allows users to battle with their favourite anime figures! 

As a tribute to the anime [Naruto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otxA7fpPMPc), the AR Voice ML Ninjutsu Battle Simulator detects user's handsigns and casts ninjutsus as holograms on the anime figures. The game runs on a turn by turn bases. Player one would cast a jutsu first. Then player 2 would casts a jutsu. Based on the difficulty of the handsigns, the jutsus do different damages. The game ends when one use runs out of health points. 

# Awards
